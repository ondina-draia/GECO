Here you can consult the files that were needed and created for our GECO project named "Into the genome of Candidatus Blochmannia pennsylvanicus".

The different folders contain:
- The tables of the different data that was obtained
- The scripts (python, pearl, bash, blast)
- The different files generated by the MAUVE program
- The output files of the EGGNOG algorithm
- The nucleic sequences and the proteic sequences used for this study
