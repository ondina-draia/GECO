Script description and explanation:

NbGen_AvgLen_GenDen.py
Computes:
- the number of genes that are present in a given sequence
- the average length of those genes
- the gene density 

OBS_EXP.pl
This Pearl script can compute
the le ratio between the frequency
of the observed dinucleotids/expected dinculeotid frequency

blastscript.sh
Create databases from each genome
and run protein BLAST against each specie.
Filter for 80% sequence coverage length and 30% identity match.

coregenome.sh
Consider only bidirectional hits
and add hits to obtain the pan genome
or compare hits to obtain the core genome.

eggnog_comparaison.py
Compare number of orthologs found in eggNOG diamond and hmmer
and found differences.
And found most common GO terms in eggNOG diamond and hmmer.
